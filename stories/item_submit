Story: submitting a new item

  As a user
  I want to add new items
  So that I can see what stuff I have

    Scenario: a user submits a new item
      Given no item named 'Star Wars IV' exists

      When a user goes to home page
      And clicks on 'Add new item'
      And fills in Name with 'Star Wars IV'
      And selects Label 'Movie'
      And clicks the Save button

      Then an item named 'Star Wars IV' should exist
      And user should see the show items page
      And page should include a notice 'new item added'
      And page should have the item's name, label
